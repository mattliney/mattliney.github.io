<h2>About Me:</h2>

<div class="container">
    <div class="text">
      <p>I am Matthew Liney, a software programmer and computer scientist. I am a recent computer science graduate from the University of Hull. I graduated with first class honours, and am currently looking for an entry-level software developer role. </p>
      <p>This website contains various examples of my university projects, personal projects, and even game jams I have participated in. I have also listed the programming languages I can use below for your convenience. <a href="#myskills">(Enough preamble? See My Skills)</a></p>
      <p>I decided I would take computer science in university due to my interest in the field. IT was always my strongest subject in school, and understanding how software is made would satisfy my curiosity.  I specifically chose computer science for games development as I play games as a hobby. The topic of games development was only a small portion of the degree however, focusing mainly on a number of other fields.</p>
      <p>If I find anything particularly interesting, I am not satisfied until I understand it intricately. It's this curiosity, I believe, that I apply to all of my interests, and projects.</p>

<h2>My Skills:</h2>
<div class="container" id="myskills">
    <div class="text">
      <p>Other than the immaculate web design and undeniably flawless writing talent you are currently witnessing? I am mainly a programmer. <b>I am experienced with the following languages: C#, C++, Javascript, Rust, CUDA. </b></p>
      <p>I have worked on a range of software development projects, solo-programming or coordinating a group of programmers. <b>These include: Game engine development, multi-threaded software, augmented reality, WPF/GUI design and implementation, 3D and 2D graphics and simulations, artificial Intelligence, networking, procedural generation, and more. </b>This mainly encompasses university projects and projects that I do for fun. See "Projects" if any of that sounds cool.</p>
      <p>I work best on complex software systems; Be they currently existing or yet-to-exist systems that need designing. Throughout the degree program, I created and worked with a dizzying number of these systems, from game engines (entirely from scratch sometimes), to particle simulations and user interfaces.</p>
      <p>In group projects, I was usually the person coordinating the team. This means that, as anyone who has finished a university degree will tell you, I have had to pick up other people's slack on occasion, and work under very strenuous deadlines.</p>
      <p>Valuable asset guaranteed, or your money back. See the <b>"Contact"</b> button at the top of the page to get in touch.</p>
