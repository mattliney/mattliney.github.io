<h2>About Me:</h2>

<div class="container">
    <div class="text">
      <p><a href="#myskills">I am a recent computer science graduate from the University of Hull.</a> I graduated with first class honours. I am currently looking for an entry-level software developer role, or any computer science /
        software engineering roles. This portfolio contains examples of my university projects, as well as personal projects, and game jam participation. As part of the degree program, game development and 
        programming was the primary focus in the honours stage and I am particularly interested in working in the game development field. Though, overall, I spent my degreee cultivating a wide
         range of skills that are not exclusive to game development, such as design and implementation of complex software systems, a LOT of debugging, managing teams of developers, problem solving, 
         and quickly adapting to using new languages. I have experience and proficiency using the following languages: C#, C++, Javascript, Rust, and CUDA.</p>

<h2>My Skills:</h2>
<div class="container" id="myskills">
    <div class="text">
      <p>Other than the immaculate web design and undeniably flawless writing talent you are currently witnessing? I am mainly a programmer. <b>I am experienced with the following languages: C#, C++, Javascript, Rust, CUDA. </b></p>
      <p>I have worked on a range of software development projects, solo-programming or coordinating a group of programmers. <b>These include: Game engine development, multi-threaded software, augmented reality, WPF/GUI design and implementation, 3D and 2D graphics and simulations, artificial Intelligence, networking, procedural generation, and more. </b>This mainly encompasses university projects and projects that I do for fun. See "Projects" if any of that sounds cool.</p>
      <p>I work best on complex software systems; Be they currently existing or yet-to-exist systems that need designing. Throughout the degree program, I created and worked with a dizzying number of these systems, from game engines (entirely from scratch sometimes), to particle simulations and user interfaces.</p>
      <p>In group projects, I was usually the person coordinating the team. This means that, as anyone who has finished a university degree will tell you, I have had to pick up other people's slack on occasion, and work under very strenuous deadlines.</p>
      <p>Valuable asset guaranteed, or your money back. See the <b>"Contact"</b> button at the top of the page to get in touch.</p>
