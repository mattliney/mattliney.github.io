<h2>About me:</h2>
<p>I am a recent computer science graduate from the University of Hull. I graduated with first class honours. I am currently looking for an entry-level software developer role, or any computer science /
     software engineering roles. This portfolio contains examples of my university projects, as well as personal projects, and game jam participation. As part of the degree program, game development and 
     programming was the primary focus in the honours stage and I am particularly interested in working in the game development field. Though, overall, I spent my degreee cultivating a wide
      range of skills that are not exclusive to game development, such as design and implementation of complex software systems, a LOT of debugging, managing teams of developers, problem solving, 
      and quickly adapting to using new languages. I have experience and proficiency using the following languages: C#, C++, Javascript, Rust, and CUDA.
